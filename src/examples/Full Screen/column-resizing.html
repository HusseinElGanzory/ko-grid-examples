<h1>Column Resizing</h1>

<p>
    Naturally, the full screen extension can be combined with column resizing. However, what happens when you
    toggle full screen mode on and off? Just what the user would expect: The grid keeps track of column widths
    in and out of full screen mode separately. Each time it is toggled, the previously configured value is
    restored.
</p>

<p class="info">
    <strong>Note</strong>: These column widths are stored in <code>localStorage</code> under the grid's id. In
    other words, the column widths are remembered across page reloads and sessions.
</p>

<p class="known-issue">
    <strong>Known Issue</strong>: Entering full screen mode does not always work properly in WebKit and Blink based browsers.
    You can still see the expected result by resizing the window/view port. This issue is tracked on
    <a href="https://github.com/benschulz/ko-grid-full-screen/issues/1">github</a>.
